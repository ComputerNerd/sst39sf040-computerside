sst39sf040-computerside
======================

This code is for people who built the sst39sf040 flasher:
<https://github.com/ComputerNerd/sst39sf040-avr>. It handles sending a file to
the Arduino Uno which will program a flash chip or receiving the contents of a
flash memory chip via the Arduino Uno flasher.

Note that I do not take credit for rs232.c and rs232.h.
